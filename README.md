A real-time warehouse package tracking system powered by ESP32 BLE beacons, React, and Firebase. Track packages in real-time, verify deliveries with Bluetooth scanning, and manage your logistics operations through an intuitive multi-portal interface.

📖 **[Read the full blog post](https://medium.com/@amitbartwal008/warehouse-automation-how-iot-real-time-tracking-are-transforming-logistics-669beeb8fb8a)** to learn more about the technology behind this project.

## ✨ Features

- **📍 Real-time Tracking**: Monitor package locations using ESP32 BLE scanners and beacons
- **🔄 Multi-Portal Interface**: Separate portals for senders, receivers, and warehouse monitoring
- **🔥 Firebase Integration**: Real-time database updates with automatic synchronization
- **📡 Bluetooth Verification**: Verify package presence using BLE scanning
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Responsive, professional interface built with React and Tailwind CSS
- **⚡ Live Updates**: Watch package status change in real-time as devices are detected
- **📊 Analytics Dashboard**: Track shipments, delivery status, and warehouse activity

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4
- **Backend**: Firebase (Realtime Database, Authentication)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM 7
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Hardware**: ESP32 (Master and Slave devices)
- **Communication Protocol**: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Firebase project** with Realtime Database and Authentication enabled
- (Optional) ESP32 devices for hardware integration

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abrtwcom/warehose-automation.git
   cd warehose-automation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**

   Copy the example environment file and add your Firebase credentials:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and fill in your Firebase configuration:

   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abc123
   ```

   > **Note**: You can get these values from your Firebase Console → Project Settings → General → Your apps → Firebase SDK snippet → Config

4. **Start development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

5. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The production-ready files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## 🔌 ESP32 Integration

The system uses ESP32 devices for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication:

- **ESP32 Master**: Acts as a BLE scanner that detects all slave devices in range
- **ESP32 Slaves**: BLE beacons attached to physical packages/products

How it works:

1. Master ESP32 continuously scans for BLE devices
2. When slaves are detected, Master updates Firebase with device presence
3. React frontend subscribes to Firebase for real-time updates
4. Package status automatically updates based on device detection

See [`ESP32_MASTER_TRIGGERED.ino`](ESP32_MASTER_TRIGGERED.ino) and [`ESP32_TRIGGER_UPDATE.md`](ESP32_TRIGGER_UPDATE.md) for detailed implementation instructions.

## 📱 Application Features

### Security Rules

Configure your Firebase Realtime Database rules according to your security requirements. For development:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```

For production, implement more granular rules based on user roles and data ownership.
